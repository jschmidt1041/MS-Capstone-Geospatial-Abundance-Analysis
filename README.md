# 🎓 MSDA Capstone: Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea Snow Crab Geospatial Abundance Analysis

The Alaska snow crab fishery was closed for two consecutive years, the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons, due to a sharp decline in the snow crab population. The closure was a result of a marine heatwave that occurred in 2018 and 2019, causing the decline in snow crab abundance. The fishery reopened for the 2024-2025 season with a limited harvest. This project was inspired by the Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea snow crab population crash and subsequent recovery, and the results are intended to serve as a resource for snow crab fishers as the fisheries reopen.

# 🗺️ Geospatial Abundance Analysis – MSDA Capstone Project

This capstone project for the M.S. in Data Analytics program at WGU focuses on a geospatial analysis of abundance metrics using Python. The objective is to integrate geospatial data with statistical modeling to uncover spatial patterns and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

- **Objective:**  
  To analyze and model spatial distributions of abundance data using geospatial techniques and machine learning.

- **Key Components:**  
  - Data acquisition and preprocessing of geospatial datasets  
  - Feature engineering and spatial joins  
  - Exploratory geospatial analysis and visualization  
  - Predictive modeling and evaluation  
  - Interpretation of spatial trends and hotspots
