# MSDA Capstone: Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea Snow Crab Geospatial Abundance Analysis

This is my capstone for my MS Data Analytics from Western Governors University - completed 2024.

The Alaska snow crab fishery was closed for two consecutive years, the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons, due to a sharp decline in the snow crab population. The closure was a result of a marine heatwave that occurred in 2018 and 2019, causing the decline in snow crab abundance. The fishery reopened for the 2024-2025 season with a limited harvest. This project was inspired by the Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea snow crab population crash and subsequent recovery, and the results are intended to serve as a resource for snow crab fishermen as the fisheries reopen.
